Files I use to have the IKEA SYMFONISK as a dimmer for an ikea IKEA TRÃ…DFRI led-lamp.

Rotate to dim the light. Single press to turn on/off, double press to turn on with dimmest setting, triple press to turn the light on with the brightest setting.

Docker compose starts zigbee2mqtt, mosquitto, node-red and the script. Node-red is not required for it to work.

See script/index.js for the actual script that does the work.
